## What is this ?

Btc seeder is a simple web app to help you convert a mnemonic passphrase to
different standards.

## Why ?

Different wallets have their own implementation of the BIP39 standard.
This tool can be used to convert your seed, so you can use it within
your prefered wallet !

It can also be used to convert your seed into my own implementation,
which is, in my opinion, easier to remember.

## Supported standards:
* [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)
* [Mnemonic.js](https://github.com/ggozad/mnemonic.js)

## Installation

To install, run

`npm install`

`grunt bowercopy`

## Other

I am not aware of all the mnemonic standards used in the crypto world.
If know one you want to see implemented, just submit a post request !
